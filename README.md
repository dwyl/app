> “_The **price** of anything is the **amount** of **life** you **exchange for it**._”
~ Henry David Thoreau

Time (a *finite* amount it) is one of the few valuable things we *all* have in common.  
Whether we like it or not, each of us only have a ***fixed amount***.  
It is perhaps the most precious ***non-renewable*** 'resource' we can think of.  
We need a *much* better and efficient way to keep a track of how we spend and manage it.
